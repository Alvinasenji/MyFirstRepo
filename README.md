Brief Introduction About Myself
Hello, my name is Alvin Asenji. I am currently embarking on an exciting learning journey with the SE 102: Foundations of Linux and Version Control course. This course is designed to equip me with essential skills in Linux command-line operations, file management, task automation, and secure process management within a Linux environment.

Beyond Linux, I'm also delving into the depths of Git for version control, focusing on repository management, collaborative software project tracking, and maintaining code quality. I'm eager to gain hands-on experience in navigating Linux command-line interfaces, understanding file permissions, and utilizing Git and GitHub for effective version history management and collaborative project work.

Course Overview
Welcome to SE 102: Foundations of Linux and Version Control! This course is designed to equip students with the foundational skills necessary for efficient system navigation, file manipulation, task automation, and secure management of processes within a Linux environment. Additionally, it offers an in-depth exploration of Git for version control, emphasizing repository management, collaborative software project tracking, and the maintenance of code quality. Through hands-on exercises and practical applications, you'll gain the competence to navigate Linux command-line interfaces, understand file permissions and security mechanisms, and utilize Git and GitHub for effective version history management and collaborative project work.

Course Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

Linux Command-Line Proficiency: Utilize Linux command-line interfaces and shell scripting for effective file navigation, manipulation, task automation, and system process management.
Linux Security and Permissions: Understand and apply Linux file permissions and security mechanisms to safeguard data and manage access controls within a Linux environment.
Version Control with Git: Initiate repositories, track changes, and employ Git for collaborative software project development, managing version history accurately.
Collaborative Development Using Git: Work collaboratively on projects using Git and GitHub, mastering branching, merging, merge conflict resolution, and contributions through pull requests and code reviews.
Advanced Git Features: Leverage advanced Git features and workflows, including branching strategies, rebasing, and remote repository management, to navigate complex software development projects efficiently.
Key Topics Covered
This course will guide you through essential concepts and practical skills in Linux and Git/GitHub:

Getting Started with GitHub: Introduction to version control systems (VCS), Git, and GitHub, including setting up a GitHub account and navigating its interface.
Git Repositories and File Management: Creating and managing repositories, understanding the importance of README files, and performing basic file operations (add, edit, delete, move) within GitHub.
Commits and Version History: Learning about commits as project snapshots, making your first commit, writing effective commit messages, and viewing/comparing/restoring versions using commit history.
Branching and Collaboration: Understanding branches for isolated work, creating and switching branches, merging branches, and creating Pull Requests (PRs) for integration.
Pull Requests and Code Reviews: Deep dive into creating PRs, using code reviews for feedback, approving changes, and merging PRs to maintain project quality.
Collaboration Workflows: Exploring concepts like forking repositories for personal copies, cloning repositories to local environments, contributing to open-source projects, and synchronizing changes using git push and git pull.
Introduction to Basic Git Commands: Hands-on experience with fundamental Git commands such as git init, git add, git commit, git status, git log, git diff, git push, and git pull.
Assessments
The course includes a series of practical assignments, activities, and quizzes:

Project-Based Assessments (90% of total grade): Weekly graded projects requiring code/command writing and file uploads. Each project is released with weekly content and has a submission deadline of the Monday of the week after at 11:59 PM GMT.
Practical GIT: 15%
Practical Shell—Basics: 12.5%
Practical Shell—Permissions: 12.5%
Practical Shell—I/O Redirections and filters: 12.5%
Practical Shell—init files, variables, and expansions: 12.5%
Practical Loops, conditions, and parsing: 12.5%
Practical Processes and signals: 12.5%
End of Course Assessment (10% of total grade): An auto-graded MCQ test at the end of the course.
Live Sessions
Each week, there will be a 2-hour live session led by the course instructor, Dr. Ehoneah Obed, to clarify concepts and answer questions. Details on time and joining links will be communicated via email and eHub announcements.
