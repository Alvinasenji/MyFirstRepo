Brief Introduction About Myself

Hello, my name is Alvin Asenji. I am currently embarking on an exciting learning journey with the SE 102: Foundations of Linux and Version Control course. This course is designed to equip me with essential skills in Linux command-line operations, file management, task automation, and secure process management within a Linux environment.

Beyond Linux, I'm also delving into the depths of Git for version control, focusing on repository management, collaborative software project tracking, and maintaining code quality. I'm eager to gain hands-on experience in navigating Linux command-line interfaces, understanding file permissions, and utilizing Git and GitHub for effective version history management and collaborative project work.
